A free, open-source book that teaches R as a functional programming language. Five parts, 33 chapters, from first function call to metaprogramming and package development.

R descends from lambda calculus through Scheme and S. This book follows that lineage: everything is an expression, every expression returns a value, functions are values. Understanding the design makes vectorization, pipes, tidyverse, and ggplot2 click into place.

No programming experience is assumed.
